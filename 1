Hadoop in layman's term:
                         >Hadoop is an open source ,software programming framework to process clusters of data in a commodity hardware
        (cost efficient hardware).Basically the need for analyzing large amount of data for buisness tends to the development of 
        big data but to process  unstructured bulk of data is a challenge.Hadoop was created by Doug Cutting and Mike Cafarella in 
        2005. It was originally developed to support distribution for the Nutch search engine project. Doug named the project as 
        hadoop after his son's toy elephant .In hadoop the files are divided into blocks and these blocks are copied to required 
        number of times.
                        >Hadoop consist of two parts:
                          1.HDFS(Hadoop Distributed File System)-It is based on google GFS(Google File System) white paper.It is a
        distributed storage system.
                          2.MapReduce-It is based on google map reduce white paper.It is a distributed processing system.  
                        >Advantages of Hadoop:  
                          *Accessible—Hadoop runs on large clusters of commodity machines or on cloud computing services such as
        Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).
                          *Fault Tolerance—Because it is intended to run on commodity hardware, Hadoop is architected with
        the assumption of frequent hardware malfunctions.It can gracefully handle most such failures.
                          *Scalable—Hadoop scales linearly to handle larger data by adding more nodes to the cluster.
                          *Simple—Hadoop allows users to quickly write efficient parallel code
